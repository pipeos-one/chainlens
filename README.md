### Frameworks

Client: https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web and https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase have been chosen in order to have cross-platform components -> we might have a mobile ChainLens in the future. We traded shiny looks over functionality. Going forward, cross-platform compatibility is preferred, unless the above mentioned packages remain obsolete (in which case, Vue.js is, again, an option).

Server is based on https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next.

### Development
